# Quantum Mechanical Keyboard Firmware

Fork of [QMK firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) with added keymaps for my keyboards.

## Added keymaps
- [JJ50](keyboards/jj50/keymaps/mjturt)
- [AMJ40](keyboards/amj40/keymaps/mjturt)
- [DZ60](keyboards/dz60/keymaps/mjturt)

Also added `dfu.sh` -script for easier flashing. Usage: 
```
./dfu.sh firmware.hex
```
